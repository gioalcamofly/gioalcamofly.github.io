  Hi, my name is Giovanni and I am a backend developer. I've worked for one of the most innovative companies in Spain as well as one of the main IT consulting companies in the Canary Islands. 
  During my career, I've got experience mainly with backend development (Python, Laravel, Java), but also with frontend development (Vue, Java) as well as IoT. I also have had to face challenges
  like teaching a junior developer who recently passed university. 

  I define myself as a curious person who likes to learn whatever I don't know yet and also as someone who tries to contribute with new ideas and points of view.

  My best skills are: <mark>Quick learning</mark> and <mark>bad jokes</mark>.
